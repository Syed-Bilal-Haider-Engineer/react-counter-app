# ðŸš€ React TypeScript Counter App

## Project Overview

This is a simple **React** application built with **TypeScript**. The app demonstrates key concepts like:

- A **Counter component** with a button to increment the counter.
- **Global state management** using React's Context API (`CounterContext` and `CounterProvider`).
- A **custom hook** (`useCounter()`) to interact with the counter's value.
- *Toast notifications** using **Chakra UI** or any toast notification library you prefer, to show real-time updates whenever the counter is incremented.

## Features

- **Incremental Counter**: A button (`+1`) that increases the count by 1 each time it's clicked.
- **Global State**: Implements a global `CounterContext` and `CounterProvider` to manage state.
- **Custom Hook**: Exposes the current count and an increment function via `useCounter()`.
- **Toast Notifications**: Displays a toast with the updated count.
- **TypeScript Support**: Ensures type safety throughout the app.
